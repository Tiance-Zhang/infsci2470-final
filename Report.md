## Introduction
We build an online shoping store for shoes, which provide a platform to let consumers see all the products and vendors, 
and to let sellers/ administrators to manage their products. 

### High-level Feartures
#### Login System
Users should login to view our webstie. If consumers don't have account, they should register first. 
Administrators would have a different login interface and website interface from common users. 
Moreover, personal information is only available to themselves.
#### Recommedation
On the homepage, we show the most popoluar shoes in the period of time. 
Consumers could see pictures and prices of these shoes to decide if they want to follow the trend.
#### Browsing and Adding
Our website allows consumers to check all the information for shoes and brands we have. 
Consumers could add/ delete shoes in the shopping cart. <br><br><br>



## Objective
We want to build a website that customers can use to discover the most trending sneakers and be able to purchase them. As
 fashion is always changing, we want our website can be made not only an online shop but also as trands reference for custmers.
 By using our website, they will know what is the most popular sneakers this season and any information about those sneakers. Besides,
 we want our website can let customers to buy any sneakers they like regardless of brand. Our website can save them time of tossing
 between various brand website by providing all popular sneaker brands.<br>
<br>
By developing our application, we want to learn how to build a complete shopping website which include user interface and
admin interface. As more and more people prefer using mobile phone nowadays, we want to create a website that can looks 
properly both on the phone and computer so we will use different viewpoints to achieve this goal. Morever, We want our 
website can let customers to register and login, as well as manage shopping cart and purchase items. 
Therefore, we need to have form for cutomers' information that can be submitted to our database and HTML5 APIs to add, delete or
update data in our database. For the unexpected input, we also need to handle such errors.

`What are the libraries, frameworks, and other technologies you used and how did you put them together. 
Use the MVC conceptual model to provide a guide (i.e. what are the models/views/controllers and what do they do).`

#### Backend:
MVC
+ Model: 
+ View:
+ Controller: 
#### Frontend: 
We use CSS and Bootstrap to optimize pages. 
After adding the link from Bootstrap page, we could use it by adding class in different elements. <br><br><br>



## Challenges
`Discuss any challenges you faced in trying to develop this app. 
Were there libraries or technologies you wanted to use but we’re frustrating? 
Where there features you couldn’t get working?`


<br><br><br>
## Future Work
In the future, we want to develop a query system, 
which it could let users to query by entering specific keywords like id or name.
Moreover, we want to develop the filter system. 
Then users could filter products by brand, name, color or price as them want. 
Finally, we want to design a payment page to realize the full function of the shopping process.<br>

If we have more time, we want to connect SQL to realize the fearture of query. <br><br><br>



## Conclusion
After taking this course, we have learned a lot. We started from the basic skills like HTML, CSS and Javascript at the beginning.
Then we had the deeper understand for the framework like React and Bootstrap. 
After all the frontend skills, we kept looking into backend skills like REST APIs and MongoDB.<br>
This course has a great learning process, it would lead us to think through every step，
and each class is related to each other, which is a continuous process.
We learned everything we want to design the webiste. <br><br><br>
